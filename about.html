                <div class="line-w"></div>
                <p>What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask?</p>
                
                <p>I can conjur a website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize
                in manipulating the very fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. Linux servers serve me,
                domains are my domain, and certificates are certain.</p>
                
                <p>Open-source technologies empower this process. I am a custom WordPress theme and plugin development expert. I fully
                embraced the Gutenberg editor and can create custom blocks from scratch for any conceivable need. I have contributed in
                small ways to these and other open-source efforts and intend to give back every chance I get<p>
                
                <p>
                  My art & design background informs ideation to design through to implementation. In 2010graduated from the Cleveland
                Institute of Art with a focus on digital arts and a mantra to always consider my audience. I will always advocate for
                the user of my interfaces; accessibility is not optional. 
                </p>
                
                <p>I can plan, design, build, launch, and maintain a website myself—did I mention that I build mobile apps too? I have
                worked on 10+ published cross-platform iOS and Android apps with React Native and Titanium SDK, roughly half of which I
                built and maintain solo.</p>
                
                <p>A full-stack developer knows no bounds. And when they find one they cross it without hesitation, boldly going into the
                unknown to return richer for it.</p>
